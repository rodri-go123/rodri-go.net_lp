## Contact

Rodrigo (he/him) is a researcher, designer, and programmer exploring the ecological and social dimensions of digital technology.

His work challenges how we build and relate to digital tools by examining the entanglements between technological and living systems. Through tinkering with, repurposing, and engaging playfully with existing tools, he aims to collectivise access to, and promote systemic literacy around, the technological systems we rely on. 

Coming from a background in graphic design and web development, Rodrigo is currently following the Non-Linear Narrative Masters at the Royal Academy of Art (KABK) in The Hague, where he is further positioning himself as a researcher alongside a practitioner.
