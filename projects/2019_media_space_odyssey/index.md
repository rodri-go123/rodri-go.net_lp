## 2019: A Media Space Odyssey is a tripartite anthology of fictional and real-world stories where the voices of minorities is questionably represented by digital media. 

![Four magazine spreads on black blackground. They all show some sort of superimposed or censored text.](assets/spreads.jpg " "){.extra-large}

This publication contrasts Hao Jinfang's sci-fi short stories 'Invisible Planets' and 'Folding Beijing' with online newspaper articles and social media posts depicting the 2019 Hong Kong protests, Chile's _Estallido Social_ (2019 â€“ 2022) and Qatar's abuse of migrant workers ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Using overlapping design elements to censor some bodies of text and highlight others, this work challenges the politics and hierarchies behind (mis)information online.
