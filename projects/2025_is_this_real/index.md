_Practicum Artium_ electives are a one-year programme organised by the Academy of Creative and Performing Arts (ACPA), a collaboration between Leiden University, the Royal Academy of Art (KABK) and the Royal Conservatoire (KC). I designed the visual identity and promotional material for their 8th edition end-of-year exhibition, _Is This Real,_ showcasing student work from painting, drawing, film and photography classes.
