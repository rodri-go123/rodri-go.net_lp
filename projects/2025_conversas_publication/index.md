## _Conversas_ is a series of monthly informal meetings to get to know each other and share projects, stories, or interests. Each series of ten Conversas is documented in a printed publication.
<br>

Bottom-up, self-organised, and DIY projects such as _Conversas_ give way to hopeful conversations on how we can do things differently ‚Äì be that about navigating complex socio-political issues, finding identity and community in shared practices, or fostering understanding through embracing the quirks of miscommunication (all topics brought up during this series of _Conversas_.) These conversations, made possible by the wonderful group of speakers, active listeners, and organisers who make it all happen, emphasise a diversity of practices and ways of knowing that inform them and allow them to speak to each other unconstrained by the strict hierarchies that shape many forms of public speaking.

It is important that such initiatives are properly documented and archived. This process allows a small project, organised locally by a team of volunteers, to become a node in a broader network of self-initiated, place-based communities that share values and knowledge, as we can see in the now global network of _Conversas_. I see the making of this publication ‚Äì as well as the event posters and the _Conversas_ website ‚Äì as my modest contribution to that effort.

Designing for such a project comes with the privilege of being playful. From the _Conversas_ 'logo,' which refuses a fixed form, to the [posters](/projects/2025_decaying_data), built on a grid system found on an IKEA instructions manual, and this publication, which occasionally borrows from punk collages while trying to give plenty of room to the many Conversadores who compose it, as well as Sebastiaan Helber‚Äôs incredible analogue photography, the work I have done for Conversas stubbornly avoids a cohesive visual style.¬†

This is much to my pleasure, though perhaps to the frustration of fellow graphic designers reading this. It is not a bold artistic statement or even an intentional choice, but rather a reflection of the process behind a project that lives purely from the genuine interest of those involved in it ‚Äì messy, experimental, and scattered over four years, which saw me through different homes, jobs, studies, cities and even countries.
