## _Conversas_ is a volunteer-run project initiated in Lisbon in 2012 and now active in many cities around the world, autonomously organised by anyone who is inspired by the format. They host a series of open informal gatherings for the sharing and discussion of projects, ideas or stories in a non-hierarchical way.

I have been involved with _Conversas_ as a designer in various capacities (see the [publication](projects/2025_conversas_publication) and [event posters](projects/2022_conversas_posters) I made for _Conversas Rotterdam_), one of which was developing this platform that connects the many iterations of the project around the world.

The website is centred around a map, showing each _Conversas_ project as a node in a broader network of self-initiated, place-based communities that share values and knowledge. The modular _Conversas_ title changes into a different assortment of drawings, symbols and typefaces, writing out the word differently each time the page is accessed. The ever-changing title reflects the project’s evolution into independently organised events, distancing it from strictly defined identities and ways of doing.
