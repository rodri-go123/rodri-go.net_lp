## The _Autonomy Lab_ is a research group that is challenging the concept of autonomy in art. They host workshops with autonomous practitioners from diverse backgrounds, such as performance artists, political activists and social workers. The visual language of these promos draws from 'do-it-yourself' and activist movements to capture the self-organised and often improvised nature of the _Autonomy Lab_.
