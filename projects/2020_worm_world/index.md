##  In times when the real world shuts down, the urgency to adapt is real, especially for independent venues like _WORM_ that thrive on human connection. _WORMworld_ is the virtual embodiment of the _Open City._ Much like _WORM_, it serves as a portal into the obscure world of alternative culture and art. It is designed in such a way that the familiarity and iconography of the emblematic _WORM_ building are translated into the web page.
